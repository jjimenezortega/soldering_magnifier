# Soldering Magnifier
A soldering magnifier based on the Rpi and PiCam.

I am an electronic engineer and soldering is one of my task when a design a PCB.

This project borned due to the trend of minimize the integrated circuits and other components in order to save cots and space. Seeking information in Google, I came across this blog post: http://operationalsmoke.blogspot.com.es/2014/05/diy-usb-soldering-microscope.html. It gave me the idea to make my own soldering magnifier/microscope

This project has two parts:

  - The 3D design for the support (in Freecad)
  - A GUI application witten in python
  
The components are:
  - A 50mm 1/4 len (www.dx.com/p/50mm-f1-4-c-mount-cctv-lens-set-w-macro-rings-for-milc-black-144836#.WqDk2-co-Ul)
  - A Rasberry Pi (with a power supply and a HDMI cable)
  - A Raspberry Pi Camera
  - A monitor
